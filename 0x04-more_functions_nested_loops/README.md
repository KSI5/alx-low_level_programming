This README file will describe the task of the project.
0-isupper.c
This program contains a function int _isupper(int c) that checks for uppercase characters.

1-isdigit.c
This program contains a function int _isdigit(int c) that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2-mul.c
This program contains a function int mul(int a, int b) that multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c
This program contains a function void print_numbers(void) that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c
This program contains a function void print_most_numbers(void) that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 (excluding 2 and 4), followed by a new line.

5-more_numbers.c
This program contains a function void more_numbers(void) that prints the numbers from 0 to 14 ten times, followed by a new line.

6-print_line.c
This program contains a function void print_line(int n) that draws a straight line in the terminal using the character _, based on the input number n.

7-print_diagonal.c
This program contains a function void print_diagonal(int n) that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the character \, based on the input number n.

8-print_square.c
This program contains a function void print_square(int size) that prints a square of size size using the character #.

9-fizz_buzz.c
This program contains a function void fizz_buzz(void) that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

10-print_triangle.c
This program contains a function void print_triangle(int size) that prints a triangle of size size using the character #.
